# `WASM` Z-prize challenge proposal (Draft)

## Introduction

WASM (WebAssembly) is the de-facto standard for smart contact VM like Polkadot, Definity, Cosmos. And also critical for wallet adoption. However, making ZKP works efficiently on WASM is still a challenge today. In Mantaâ€™s internal benchmark, we can observe 10x - 15x performance penalty on WASM compared with X86 native binary. This WASM ZKP challenge is bring breakthroughs in compilation to make ZKP on WASM (both prover and verifier)

Goal: Test the correctness and performance of WASM binaries on some operations that are common in ZKP systems.

(Note: Bls12-381 can be replaced with any ZK friendly curves)

In particular, we consider three types of test suites:
* Low-Degree Extension: Measure the performance of (I)FFT
* Product of Pairings: Measure the performance of billinear pairing
* Multi-Scalar Multiplication: Measure the performance of scalar multiplication

## Dependencies:

* [Rust toolchain](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
* `wasm-pack` package:
    ```bash
    cargo install wasm-pack
    ```
* `chrome`:
    ```bash
    apt install google-chrome-stable
    ```
* `chromedriver`:
    ```bash
    apt install chromium-chromedriver
    ```

## Run the benchmark

* WASM time:
    ```bash
    ./serve.sh
    ```
    You can view the result at `localhost:8080`.
* Headless WASM time:
    ```bash
    wasm-pack test --headless --chrome --release
    ```
* Native time:
    ```bash
    cargo bench
    ```
